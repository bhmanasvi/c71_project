    <p class="list-group-item-text">This informs parents about their child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students’ absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum’s subjects. As soon as you enter a student’s Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin enters login details into this tracker.</p>

    <h4>school Canteen</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <p class="list-group-item-text">Regular attendance is a key requisite for all students of St. Xavier's. A student should have a minimum of 75% of class day's attendance (Examination Board Rule) failing which the student may not receive promotion to the next level. In such cases, such students would have to repeat in the same class or be withdrawn.
      No pupil may absent himself/herself without obtaining leave previously, in writing. If for any reason, a student is absent without prior permission, on his/her return he/she must submit a letter from his/her parent/guardian, stating the reason for the absence and obtain permission from the principal or the vice principal before entering the class.
      In all cases of absence, the parent/guardian should make an entry in the student's diary on the appropriate page marked 'Non Attendance and Leave Record".
